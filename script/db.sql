COPY public.opinion (id, opinion_type, summary, case_id) FROM stdin;
1	MAJORITY	No particular test of insanity has developed as a constitutional baseline, and it is not for the courts to require any single criteria. 	1
3	MAJORITY	The "American Rule" that all parties must pay their own attorneys' fees, win or lose, applies in all cases except where explicit exceptions are made in the statute. 	2
4	DISSENT	Kansas may create its own definition of insanity, but that is not what happened here. Instead, Kansas eliminated the core of any insanity defense.	1
17	MAJORITY	"Barton’s aggravated assault offenses were crimes involving moral turpitude and therefore 'referred to in section1182(a)(2).' He committed the offenses during his initial seven years of residence and was later convicted of the offenses, thereby rendering him inadmissible. Barton was, therefore, ineligible for cancellation of removal."\n\nIn context of the statute, inadmissible is a status that can apply to someone already living in the country.	10
18	DISSENT	To trigger the time stop rule, an offense must render the immigrant "inadmissible" or "deportable". The INA has two tracks for dealing with non citizens seeking admission and those already admitted. The Majority incorrectly conflates these two terms.  "Barton cannot and should not be considered inadmissible for purposes of the stop-time rule because he has already been admitted to the country."\n\nTo render him ineligible for relief from removal, the government would need to show he has committed a "deportable" offense, which it has not done.	10
6	CONCURRENCE	Apodaca, a 4-4-1 opinion lacks precedential force, since the binding opinion is that of a single justice writing only for himself. Note: this section of the majority opinion only has 3 justices and lacks the force of the opinion of the court.	3
7	CONCURRENCE	The argument from LA that a decision against them would encourage other defendants with final judgments to launch new appeals is overblown.	3
8	CONCUR_JUDGEMENT	Sixth Amendment’s protection against non-unanimous felony guilty verdicts applies against the States through the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the 14th Amendment, not the Due Process Clause. 	3
9	CONCURRENCE	Kavanaugh writes separately to point out that every member of the court has now voted to overturn some existing precedent and lists out many consequential decisions of the court that overturned previous precedent to show that Stare Decisis does not have to be followed if the previous opinion is erroneous. He lays out a 3 step test: 1) previous opinion must be egregiously wrong.  2) the previous opinion caused negative real world consequences. 3) Would overruling the previous opinion cause a heavy burden on those relying on that opinion.	3
10	DISSENT	Stare Decisis gets a rough treatment in this case. It was entirely reasonable for LA to rely on the precedent of Apodaca and since LA has now changed laws to require unanimous juries, there is little practical benefit to overruling precedent.\n\nAdditionally the majorities claims that the origins of the law are racist unfairly tarnish the reputation of Louisiana. 	3
5	MAJORITY	A unanimous jury has been part of common law since the 14th century. If the 6th amendment requires unanimous juries for federal courts, then the 14th amendment requires this for state courts as well. The circumstances of the case oppose applying stare decisis.\n\nThe dissent must argue that the 14th amendment guarantees a right but the courts cannot enforce that right because of stare decisis, a very convoluted position to try to defend.	3
11	MAJORITY	In Arizona v. United States, the court ruled that a state law making it a crime to obtain employment while in the country illegally was not allowed as it directly conflicted with the federal IRCA. \n\nBut in this case congress does not preempt Kansas from prosecuting identity theft by using another person's social security number on a federal form. The Kansas identity theft convictions stand.	7
12	CONCURRENCE	Agree with majority and writes separately to say that the court should explicitly abandon the "purposes and objectives" pre-emption jurisprudence.\n\nThe doctrine of "purposes and objectives" pre-emption impermissibly rests on judicial guesswork about "broad federal policy objectives, legislative history, or generalized notions of congressional purposes that are not contained within the text of federal law."	7
13	DISSENT_JUDGEMENT	Agree with majority that nothing in IRCA expressly preempts the Kansas law as applied to this case.\n\nBut there is an implied preemption with the acts structure, content, and purpose to reserve "to the Federal Government—and thus takes from the States—the power to prosecute people for misrepresenting material information in an effort to convince their employer that they are authorized to work in this country."	7
14	MAJORITY	The plain language of the statute indicates the FDCPA intended for the statute of limitations to expire 1 year after the violation. Congress understands how to write a general discovery rule into the law and did not do so in this case.	8
15	DISSENT_JUDGEMENT	Ordinarily a discovery doctrine would not apply to FDCPA, however Rotkiske alleges fraud in the servicing of that complaint by using an address where Rotkiske no longer lived. If fraud cased Rotkiske to miss the timely window to bring the claim, he should be able to get relief.	8
16	CONCURRENCE	Agree with the majority that the court of appeals correctly decided that Rotkiske failed to preserve an argument for an "equitable, fraud-specific discovery rule" .\n\nThe court has long held that exceptions exist for suits based on fraud, and nothing in this decision "prevents parties from invoking that well-settled doctrine."  	8
19	MAJORITY	It is a reasonable inference that Glover was driving his own truck.\n\nThis is a narrow holding, as police must take in the totality of the circumstances, and the presence of additional facts might dispel reasonable suspicion.	11
20	CONCURRENCE	The facts specific to Kansas' scheme for revoking licenses are important. To have a license revoked, a person must have shown a pattern of being willing to defy driving laws.\n\nThe question is, is it reasonable to assume someone who has had their license revoked would risk penalty to drive again? The fact that Glover previously showed a propensity to disregard the law, and that the deputy who stopped the car knew this, is relevant to the 4th amendment argument.	11
21	DISSENT	The majority lowers the states burden of proof under the 4th amendment by wrongly requiring evidence negating the inference that suspicion is justified, rather than requiring evidence to show suspicion is justified.	11
22	MAJORITY	The plain language of the contract creates a warrant of safety. 	12
23	DISSENT	Cannot read the contract as providing a warrant of safety, and the case should be remanded for fact finding on maritime industry practices.	12
24	MAJORITY	In general, congress has the power to abrogate state sovereign immunity via statute. However, the Copyright Remedy Clarification Act (CRCA), which includes such abrogation language, is blocked by precedent (Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank).\n\nUnder article I intellectual property clause, congress does not have the authority to override state sovereign immunity. Under the 14th amendment, congress must be responding to a pattern of injury, and congress has failed to show that pattern or how CRCA would address it by abrogating sovereign immunity.\n\n	13
25	CONCUR_JUDGEMENT	Agree with the conclusion but disagree on two points. 1) Stare Decisis does not require special circumstances. "If our decision in Florida Prepaid were demonstrably erroneous, the Court would be obligated to "correct the error, regardless of whether other factors support overruling the precedent."\n\n2) Don't join the majority's discussion about future copyright decisions since this court should only look at cases before it.\n\nFinally, there is still an unresolved question of whether copyrights are property under the 14th amendment that is not address or resolved by the court in this case.	13
26	CONCUR_JUDGEMENT	The court was wrong in some sovereign-immunity precedents, including Florida Prepaid. However, having decided those cases, they are clearly controlling precedent.	13
27	MAJORITY	Maui's argument that the pollutant must be dumped directly into the destination is too narrow and interferes with the EPAs ability to regulate point of source discharges. That reading would open a loophole to easily evade EPA permitting.\n\nBut the Ninth Circuit establishes a "fairly traceable" standard that is too broad, and would allow penalties for pollutants that reach navigable waters years from their initial release. \n\nThe new standard will be a "functional equivalent of direct discharge." Courts can provide further clarification using the CWA intent and text. Time and distance will also be a factor.\n\nCA09 decision is vacated and remanded to consider this new standard.	14
28	CONCURRENCE	The opinion today is consistent with Justice Scalia's plurality opinion in Rapanos v. United States.\n\nThe dissent from this opinion states that the court doesn't commit to which factors are important for the new standard, but that is not the case. The court specifically specifies time and distance and gives some guidance to the underlying vague wording in the CWA.	14
29	DISSENT	A precise reading of the text of CWA would indicate that only direct discharge is covered by the statute. Regulating ground water discharge should be left to the states.\n\nAdditionally the court is not bound by precedent in Rapanos because the plurality opinion did not decide the issues at hand.  	14
30	DISSENT	Two possible readings of the CWA would indicate either 1) A pollutant "from" a point of source is discharged directly into navigable water. Or 2) pollutant "from" a point of source eventually makes its way to a navigable water.\n\nThe court chooses neither of these approaches and instead adopts a new rule, not supported by statutory text and gives no clear guidelines on how to apply it.\n\nThe court should have adopted interpretation 1, that a permit is required only for direct discharge from a point of source. The term point of source is very broad, and EPA enforcement should focus on that.	14
31	PER_CURIUM	Petitioners argue that ERISA imposes no duty to act on insider information, and the government cautions that acting on insider information could run into issues with insider trading laws. Because these arguments were not addressed in the lower court, this court will not address them. Remand the case to the lower court for further fact finding.	15
32	CONCURRENCE	Agree with the per curium opinion to remand this case, with the note that CA02 may use the same argument to refuse to hear the new arguments.\n\nIf they do, it seems the questions raised are already precluded by Third Bancorp v. Dudenhoeffer.	15
33	CONCURRENCE	Agree with the per curium, and notes that this question will need to come before the court sooner or later. Also note that Third Bancorp v. Dudenhoeffer should not be read as broadly as Kagan suggests.	15
34	MAJORITY	Through various statutes, congress has empowered the executive branch to make payments in the event of injuries suffered by aliens outside the United States. If congress had intended to write a remedy for this situation, they could do so.\n\nA Bivens remedy (allowing a federal official to be sued for a constitutional violation) would be an expansion of the Bivens precedent, and is not appropriate since it would be the judiciary interfering in the execution of the other branches of government.	17
35	CONCURRENCE	Should consider discarding Bivens altogether.	17
36	DISSENT	Rogue US officer conduct falls under existing Bivens remedy. The setting may be new, but the lack of any other means of recourse or remedy, and the fact that foreign policy would not be impacted by this case, means that a Bivens remedy should apply.	17
37	MAJORITY	The court has already twice rejected the usage of a looser "motivating factor" standard for contract disputes. To show racial discrimination, the plaintiff must show that the injury would not have occurred "but-for" race.\n\nThe motivating factor standard is used by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, but if congress has shown no intent to apply that standard to USC$1981, which effects contract law. The two statutes have different legislative histories and should not be conflated.	18
38	CONCUR_JUDGEMENT	Comcast puts forth a narrow reading of USC$1981 to apply only to the final formulation of a contract. The majority does not resolve this, as it is not necessary to do so to resolve the "but-for" standard question.\n\nIn Comcast's view, it would be permissible to require 1 letter of reference for a white person and 5 for a black person. If ESN can prove race was a "but-for" factor in any part of the contract negotiations, they should be able to bring the suit.\n\nBecause the court reserves this question for remand, I can concur in the Judgement of the majority.	18
39	CONCURRENCE	A bankruptcy court's order unreservedly denying relief from the automatic stay constitutes a final, immediately appealable order.	19
40	PER_CURIUM	Ordinary practice of the court is to vacate and dismiss when the case becomes moot.\n\nPetitioners did not seek damages in the initial suit, so there is no reason to rule on the merits. The district court can consider, on remand, if the petitioners can add a damage claim to their suit.	20
41	CONCURRENCE	Agree with the per curium dismissal as moot. But the court will soon need to address if federal and state courts are not correctly applying Heller and McDonald.	20
42	DISSENT	The court should not dismiss this case as moot. It is still a live case because the petitioners did not see all relief they were requesting by the new laws, and the petitioners should be able to seek damages for the constitutional violation.\n\nIf the case were decided on the merits the petitioners would prevail under Heller.	20
43	DISSENT	The travel restriction imposed by NYC is also unconstitutional.	20
44	MAJORITY	The Government Edicts Doctrine does not allow the law to be copyrighted, and Georgia’s characterization of the annotations as non-binding and non-authoritative undersells their use and value, since they are prepared in an official act of the Georgia legislature.\n\nThe Government Edicts Doctrine derives from the principal that no one owns the law. The doctrine applies when legislatures act in their official capacity and OCGA is created as part of the discharging of these duties.\n	21
45	DISSENT	Court should leave it to congress to decide if the Copyright Act needs an update. The majority has to strain themselves into showing that the commission that produces the OCGA is part of the legislature. \n\nThese annotations do not purport to have the force of law, unlike acts of the legislature and judicial opinions, and therefore do not fall under the government edicts doctrine.  	21
46	DISSENT	The court tries to respect centuries old precedent of the government edicts doctrine, but does not properly examine the reasons for that precedent. This is a pattern of taking precedents at face value without critical examination that is a frequent error of the court.	21
47	DISSENT	OCGA annotations are descriptive rather that proscriptive. While official acts of the legislature pertaining to their law making abilities are not copyrightable, that is not all the legislature does. The OCGA should be held as a copyrightable material.	21
48	MAJORITY	"The federal courts applying and extending Bob Richards have not pointed to any significant federal interest sufficient to support the Bob Richards rule."\n\nState law is sufficient to determine disputes, even in federal tax refund cases. Lower courts should apply the relevant state laws to determine who gets the tax refund in this particular case.	22
52	DISSENT_JUDGEMENT	Agree with the majority that the local courts have jurisdiction, but disagree that the homeowners count as potentially responsible parties.\n\nThe majority uses a narrow passage of the act to support his definition, but any common sense reading of the phrase would imply that a person who, under the same act, is not liable, and even if they were, have long since passed the statute of limitations for the liability. There is nothing in the act or other federal law that could hold these homeowners liable (for something no one disputes is not their fault), so how could they be potentially liable parties?	23
50	CONCUR_JUDGEMENT	Agree and join the majority opinion that the judgement below should be reversed and that the homeowners are  potentially responsible parties.\n\nBut the court should not have ruled on the issue of local court jurisdiction, since on remand the case will either be dismissed or placed on hold for EPA approval, thus the court does not need to resolve this question at this point.	23
53	MAJORITY	Federal courts have sole jurisdiction for claims arising from the superfund cleanup. The homeowners in this case are suing for remedy for trespass and nuisance which fall under Montana law, not the superfund act. The Montana Supreme Court is affirmed in this regard.	23
49	MAJORITY	The definition for Potentially Responsible Parties is very clear in the act, and includes these landowners even if they are not liable, and they were not involved in settlement negotiations. This is not a permanent easement, this restriction only covers "storage, confinement, perimeter protection using dikes, trenches, or ditches, clay cover, neutralization, cleanup of released hazardous substances and associated contaminated materials."\n\nThese restrictions apply so long as the superfund site exists, and the superfund list is updated annually. The purpose of the Act is to create an orderly process that falls under the EPA, and this ruling is consistent with that intent.\n\nIf the homeowners want a remedy that under MT law must be used to repair the damaged property, they must first get EPA approval. The Montana Supreme Court is affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.	23
54	MAJORITY	ERISA is clear and the term "actual knowledge" is defined in the text and precedent. The knowledge must be more than hypothetical.\n\nThis ruling does not preclude the usual ways of determining actual knowledge. A plaintiff who reads the disclosures will be bound by oath to say so. Actual knowledge can also be proved through "inference from circumstantial evidence."	24
55	MAJORITY	Petitioners had become eligible for relief in subsequent rulings to their final removal order. They filed a notice to appeal after the 90 window, arguing the window should be equitably tolled.\n\nThis appeal was denied by the district court. CA05 refused to hear the appeal stating they did not have jurisdiction because The Immigration and Nationality Act limits judicial review of a final deportation order when the defendants are being removed from drug crimes.\n\nCA05 erred in ruling they do not have jurisdiction. The equitable tolling question is a matter of law regarding undisputed facts and falls under the exceptions to the INA restrictions. CA05 is vacated and remanded for further proceedings.	26
56	DISSENT	This decision expands the scope of judicial review outside of the statute passed by congress. Equitable tolling is a mixed question of law and fact. The majority effectively nullifies what should be a valid jurisdiction stripping statute.	26
57	MAJORITY	Congress intended the bar on judicial review of the patent board agency to streamline the process. Click-to-Call's appeal challenges not the manner in which the agency's review proceeds once instituted, but whether the agency should have instituted review at all. That type of determination is not judicially reviewable. 	27
58	DISSENT	With this decision, the court cedes core judicial powers to bureaucratic officials. "Nothing in the statue commands this result, and nothing in the Constitution permits it."	27
59	MAJORITY	Plaintiffs correctly sue for damages under the Tucker Act. "The Risk Corridors statute is fairly interpreted as mandating compensation for damages, and neither exception to the Tucker Act applies."\n\nThe plain meaning of the statute requires to government to pay its obligation and nothing in the statute indicates the risk corridor program should be budget neutral. 	28
60	DISSENT	The court has held that private rights of action against the federal government must be explicitly created by congress. "Today, however, the Court infers a private right of action that has the effect of providing a massive bailout for insurance companies that took a calculated risk and lost."\n\nThe Tucker Act does not by itself create a right of action, the court here concludes that the ACA implicitly does. The "shall pay" language used in the statute appears in many other pieces of legislation, making this decision much more broad than the majority claims. 	28
61	MAJORITY	To preserve a claim on appeal, the defense lawyer must inform the trial judge of the objection. The lawyer in this case argued for a specific sentence, and that argument is sufficient to bring the objection to the courts attention.	29
62	CONCURRENCE	"I agree with the Court that a defendant who requests a specific sentence during a sentencing hearing need not object to the sentence after its pronouncement in order to preserve a challenge to its substantive reasonableness (i.e., length) on appeal"\n\nThe question not before the court, and therefore not decided, is if there must be a specific objection to the procedures used in arriving at a sentence. The opinion does not obviate the need to raise other objections to presume appeal. " Requiring a party to bring an error to the attention of the court enables the court to correct itself, obviating the need for an appeal. At the very least, the court can explain its reasoning and thus assist the appellate process. A court cannot address particular arguments or facts not brought to its attention."\n\nThis opinion does not decide whether argument that he did not pose a substantial danger to the public is preserved. Lower courts will need to make these decisions on a case by case basis. 	29
63	MAJORITY	The determination of habitual residence does not turn on the existence of an actual agreement. The totality of circumstances looks at all available evidence to determine habitual residence, and the argument that having an agreement would deter abductions seems less likely than requiring the courts to look at all evidence would deter abductions, and make it less likely for an abductor to manipulate the system.	30
64	CONCUR_JUDGEMENT	Agree with the courts judgement in this case, but it should be narrowly applied to infants too young to acclimate to their surroundings. The majority opinion has language that could apply to older children as well. This case before the court was only about an infant.	30
65	CONCUR_JUDGEMENT	Agree with the judgement of the court, however the term habitual residence turns on the definition of habitual and potentially the definition of home.\n\nDetermining habitual residence involves a fact based inquiry, but is not only a question of fact. Therefore the standard of review should be abuse of discretion, not clear error.	30
66	MAJORITY	Second or successive habeas petition is a term of art derived from precedent. Since this case does not meet that definition, the appeal is considered timely.	25
67	DISSENT	Petitioner is able to evade the courts rules on second or successive habeas petitions by affixing a 59(e) label. If he had called the petition what it was, just a re-hash of his previous petition, it would have been denied.	25
68	MAJORITY	The appointments clause is intended to have broad scope, but there are certain functions of congress to exercise executive authority outside of the clause. For example, congress passes laws concerning the governing of Washington DC. Positions may be appointed for that governing that do not require senate confirmation.\n\nBecause the puerto rico oversight board is local in scope, with its members having primarily local duties, those position do not count as officers of the United States under the appointment clause. 	6
69	CONCUR_JUDGEMENT	The courts decision is correct but how the reach it is wrong. Instead, we should look at the original meaning of officer of the United States in the appointment clause which was understood to be related to articles I, II, and III of the constitution. The Puerto Rico Oversight Board is an article IV territorial power structure, and therefore falls outside of the scope of officers of the United States.	6
70	CONCUR_JUDGEMENT	On June 3 1950, Puerto Rico started an exercise in self government tied to the United States. Neither side in this case raises any issues with how Puerto Rico's home rule might effect future federal office appointments, so the court does not decide the issue, and I concur with the judgment of the court.\n\nPuerto Rico drafted its own constitution which was ratified by the US congress. This would imply that the US has ceded the power of appointment of territorial officers to Puerto Rico. The court correctly does not address this issue as neither party brought it up.	6
71	MAJORITY	"A statutory violation occurs if an employer intentionally relies in part on an individual employee’s sex when deciding to discharge the employee.  Because discrimination on the basis of homosexuality or transgender status requires an employer to intentionally treat individual employees differently because of their sex, an employer who intentionally penalizes an employee for being homosexual or transgender also violates Title VII."\n\nIt is not a defense for employers to say that intentional discrimination based on homosexuality or transgender status is not based on sex. Same if an employer refused to hire someone for being gay or transgender.\n\nThe employers would like to argue that on the basis of sex meant something different in 1964 at the time of passage than it does today, that the court should only point out the conflict and then defer to congress, despite the plain text reading of the statute. The court has long rejected that sort of reasoning.	4
72	DISSENT	This is the court legislating, not interpreting legislation. Title VII prevents discrimination on "race, color, religion, sex, and national origin". This list does not include sexual orientation or gender identity. Even as understood today, the concept of sex is different from sexual orientation. "Our duty is to interpret statutory terms to mean what they conveyed to reasonable  people at the time they were written.” (citing Scalia from 2012).\n\n"The question in these cases  is not whether discrimination because of sexual orientation or gender identity should be outlawed. The  question is whether Congress did that in 1964. It indisputably did not."	4
73	DISSENT	The plaintiffs turned to this novel argument that discrimination based on sexual orientation is discrimination on the basis of sex under Title VII. In order to accept that interpretation, plaintiffs must show that courts must follow the literal meaning of the statute, not the ordinary meaning, or that the ordinary meaning of "discriminate because of sex" includes sexual orientation.\n\n"A good textualist is not a literalist" - Scalia (1997). Laws must be understood by the people they govern, and judges have a responsibility to interpret the law in a way that these people would understand the law to mean.\n\nAs to the ordinary meaning of the phrase, there is no question, both in 1964 and today, that sex and sexual orientation are separate categories.\n\nLGBTQ Americans can take pride in today's result, in a long and hard fought battle for equal treatment in fact and in law. However, this should have been the role of congress, not the role of the courts.	4
74	PER_CURIUM	"We conclude that Andrus has shown deficient performance under the first prong of Strickland, and that there is a significant question whether the Court of Criminal Appeals properly considered prejudice under the second prong of Strickland. We thus grant Andrus’ petition for a writ of certiorari and his motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis, vacate the judgment of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, and remand the case for the court to address the prejudice prong of Strickland in a manner not inconsistent with this opinion. "	31
75	DISSENT	The Texas CCA clearly decided the issue of prejudice in their ruling below. CCA did not explain the decision but failure to explain is not the same as failure to decide. And Andrus nowhere in his brief claims that the CCA failed to reach a decision on prejudice. The CCA has already held that Andrus failed to establish precedence and should not be required to revisit the issue.	31
76	MAJORITY	It is permissible for the lower court to weigh aggravating and mitigating evidence after successful habeas petition for review in place of a new jury.\n\nMcKinney argues that precedent in Ring v Arizona and Hurst v Florida would apply to his case, but his final death sentence order occurred before these cases and they do not apply retroactively.	32
78	MAJORITY	Acting Secretary Duke had a responsibility in determining how to wind down the DACA program as a matter of administrative proceedure. The claim that she had to immediately end it because the AG called the program unconstitutional is unsupported by the CA05 ruling on DAPA. "Eliminating benefits eligibility while continuing forbearance thus remained squarely\nwithin Duke’s discretion."\n\n"That omission alone renders Duke’s decision arbitrary and capricious, but it was not the only defect." While the agency was not required to pursue all possible accommodations for DACA enrollees, it was required to assess and weigh concerns against policy interests. 	16
82	DISSENT_JUDGEMENT	DACA was unlawful since its inception and the majority does not even try to explain why the court should be able to scrutinize the rescission of an unlawful program. So long as the determination by the agency that the program is unlawful, the rescission of the program is clearly reasonable.\n\nToday's decision is an effort to avoid a politically controversial but legally correct outcome. But worse, it creates perverse incentives. "Under the auspices of today’s decision, administrations can bind their successors by unlawfully adopting significant legal changes through Executive Branch agency memoranda."\n\nAgree with the plurality that rescinding DACA does not violate the equal protection clause.	16
83	DISSENT	The administration attempted to end the DACA program early on, but this been held up in the courts. Now today, the majority tells the administration to go back and try again, which means that, although the administration has the authority to end the program, it will not be able to do so for an entire presidential term. Our system is not supposed to work this way.	16
84	DISSENT_JUDGEMENT	All 9 members of the court and the petitioners themselves accept that the administration has the authority to rescind DACA. The legal dispute is over narrow statutory constraints on the power to rescind the program.\n\n"Under ordinary application of the arbitrary-and-capricious standard, the Nielsen Memorandum—with its alternative and independent rationales and its discussion of reliance—would pass muster as an explanation for the Executive Branch’s action." But the majority considers the Nielsen memo as a post hoc justification, and does not apply it to the case.\n\nThe official judicial remedy for an agency providing insufficient explanation is to remand for further explanation. It makes no sense to throw out a non-arbitrary and capricious explanation from the agency director for being post hoc, only to ask them to resubmit with further explanation.\n\nAgree with the plurality that rescinding DACA does not violate the equal protection clause.	16
85	MAJORITY	"Because the two suits here involved different marks and different conduct occurring at different times, they did not share a 'common nucleus of operative facts'."\n\nThe 2005 claim centered around the trademark of "Get Lucky" while the 2011 claim is around the use of the word "Lucky" in other related trademarks, not the trademark "Get Lucky" itself. 	33
86	MAJORITY	Petitioners are beneficiaries of the defined benefits plan from US Bank. However, win or lose, they would still receive the same payout from the plan. Therefore they have no standing under Article III to bring the case.\n\n"[D]efined-benefit plan participants have standing to sue if the plan’s mismanagement was so egregious that it substantially increased the risk that the plan and the employer would fail and be unable to pay the participants’ future benefits. The plaintiffs do not assert that theory of standing here, nor did their complaint allege that level of mismanagement."	34
87	CONCURRENCE	The court correctly concludes that the petitioners lack standing. In cases like this, the court has made the question of Article III standing more complicated than it has to be. All the court should have to consider is if a private right was violated as part of ERISA or any contract.	34
88	DISSENT	The conclusion that pensioners cannot bring a claim for misconduct until the pension is on the verge of default is illogical and violates precedent.\n\nPetitioners have an interest in the integrety of the their retirement plan. Here they allege $750MM in loses due to mismanagement, which should be sufficient for standing.\n\n"Petitioners have standing because a breach of\nfiduciary duty is a cognizable injury, regardless whether\nthat breach caused financial harm or increased a risk of nonpayment."\n\nPetitioners also have standing to sue on their retirement plan's behalf. \n\nERISA and the pension plan in this case require the funds to be managed prudently. But the court in this case provides no legal remedy for when they are not. The purpose of fiduciary duties is to prevent retirement plan failures in the first place, not to wait until after the fact to bring legal claims. 	34
103	MAJORITY	Sineneng-Smith raised questions to her first amendment rights on appeal. She did not raise questions to that of the first amendment rights of others or the law in question more broadly.\n\nCA09 abused its discretion by inviting amici briefs around the constitutionality of the law including arguments not raised in the lower courts. The case is remanded for decision based on the application of the law to Sineneng-Smith's first amendment rights in the context of her case, and not the application of the law more broadly.  	43
81	DISSENT_JUDGEMENT	Foreclosing any challenges under the equal protection clause is unwarranted and premature at this stage of litigation. "I would not so readily dismiss the allegation that an executive decision disproportionately harms the same racial group that the President branded as less desirable mere months earlier. "	16
77	DISSENT	Ring v Arizona requires a death sentence to come from a jury, not a trial judge. Ring does not apply retroactively to this case unless this case is a direct review and not a collateral review.\n\n"Direct review immediately challenges a conviction; collateral review, occurring after a completed appeal, is secondary and limited" (Brecht v. Abrahamson).\n\nThis case should be considered a direct review, and therefore the Ring precedent should apply.	32
104	CONCURRENCE	The Ninth Circuit did not just misapply the party presentation doctrine in this case, but also the overbreadth doctrine - the idea that a law can be unconstitutional if a large number of its applications are unconstitutional. The court's overbreadth doctrine is not supported by the constitution and is a misapplication of the first amendment.   	43
89	MAJORITY	To convict under the wire fraud statute, the government must prove that there was a deception or fraud with the intent of obtaining property or money.\n\nThe false story about the traffic study that caused four days of gridlock in the city as political retribution did not cause any of the perpetrators to receive money. \n\nTaking over lanes of the bridge is not obtaining property because it is a scheme to alter a regulatory choice, which does not count as taking government property.  And while the government does have a property interest in its employees time and wages, the wages of the bridge workers were not the object of the fraud, they were an incidental, even anticipated cost of the scheme. The defendants did not try to obtain the services provided by these employees.\n\n"Not every corrupt act by state or local officials is a federal crime. Because the scheme here did not aim to obtain money or property, Baroni and Kelly could not have violated the federal-program fraud or wire fraud laws."	35
90	MAJORITY	"The Lanham Act provision governing remedies for trademark violations, §1117(a), makes a showing of willfulness a precondition to a profits award in a suit under §1125(c) for trademark dilution, but §1125(a) has never required such a showing."\n\nSince the jury found violation of §1125(a), requiring willfulness would be writing in requirements not written into the law. That's especially bad in a law that otherwise is very careful about specifying mens rea conditions. 	36
91	CONCURRENCE	"We took this case to decide whether willful infringement is a prerequisite to an award of profits under 15 U. S. C. §1117(a). The decision below held that willfulness is such a prerequisite. App. to Pet. for Cert. 32a. That is incorrect. The relevant authorities, particularly pre-Lanham Act case law, show that willfulness is a highly important consideration in awarding profits under §1117(a), but not an absolute precondition. I would so hold and concur on that ground."	36
92	CONCUR_JUDGEMENT	Agree that The Lanham Act does not impose a willfulness requirement. But willfulness covers a very large range of mental states.\n\n"The majority suggests that courts of equity were just as likely to award profits for such 'willful' infringement as they were for 'innocent' infringement. But that does not reflect the weight of authority, which indicates that profits were hardly, if ever, awarded for innocent infringement."\n\n"Because the majority is agnostic about awarding profits for both 'willful' and innocent infringement as those terms have been understood, I concur in the judgment only."	36
93	MAJORITY	The plain meaning of the statute requires that any personnel actions be untainted by age. "To obtain reinstatement, damages, or other relief related to the end result of an employment decision, a showing that a personnel action would have been different if age had not been taken into account is necessary, but if age discrimination played a lesser part in the decision, other remedies may be appropriate." 	37
94	CONCURRENCE	Join the majority and make two observations. 1) The court does not foreclose claims arising from discriminatory processes. 2) Damage remedies may be possible even when the government engages in non-dispositive discrimination. \n\nAn example would be an aptitude test given only to applicants for a job that are over 40. "If an applicant incurs costs to prepare for the discriminatorily administered aptitude test, a damages award compensating for such out-of-pocket expenses could restore the applicant to the position that he or she would have enjoyed absent discrimination."	37
95	DISSENT	Previously the court had held that the but-for cause standard should apply unless statutory text explicitly says otherwise. This new rule that any decision tainted by consideration of age "is so broad that a plaintiff could bring a cause of action even if he is ultimately promoted or hired over a younger applicant."	37
96	MAJORITY	Shular argues that congress intended ACCA to cover crimes as understood at the time of passage, but congress clearly lays out particular behaviors that qualify for enhanced sentencing, and these behaviors do not have to match to generic offenses. 	38
97	CONCURRENCE	"This Court has repeatedly explained that the rule of lenity applies only in cases of 'grievous' ambiguity—where the court, even after applying all of the traditional tools of statutory interpretation, 'can make no more than a guess as to what Congress intended.'\n\n"Because the Court correctly concludes that the rule of lenity does not apply in this case, I join the Court's opinion in full."	38
98	MAJORITY	The "New York" convention is silent on non-signatory enforcement and says nothing about domestic equitable doctrine. It would be unnatural to intemperate the convention to be replacing domestic law without clearly doing so in the text.\n\nBecause the convention does not address non-signatory issues brought up in this case, the appeals court will need to evaluate the domestic equitable doctrine on remand to determine if GE can use it to enforce arbitration.	39
99	CONCURRENCE	Agree with the majority that the convention does not prohibit using domestic law in determining arbitration enforcement. However, the courts should note that "Any applicable domestic doctrines must be rooted in the principle of consent to arbitrate." Much is left to the states to determine their own rules for equitable estoppel. 	39
100	MAJORITY	Atlantic secured a special use permit from the Forest Service for a 0.1 mile section of pipe through the Appalachian National Scenic Trail. CA04 held that the service cannot grant this permit as the trail is part of the national park system.\n\n"An examination of the interests and authority granted under the Trails Act shows that the Forest Service 'right-of-way' agreements with the National Park Service for the Appalachian Trail did not convert 'Federal lands' under the Leasing Act into 'lands' within the 'National Park System'."\n\nThe argument that the National Park Service should control the lands the trail crosses would be a massive expansion of the authority of the Park Service. \n\n	41
101	DISSENT	The majority engages in a complicated discussion of land use and property rights, but the actual question is simple. Is the Appalachian Scenic Trail in the National Park System? If so, then the forest service cannot grant a pipeline right of way that crosses the trail.\n\n'Today's Court suggests that the Trail is not "land" in the Park System at all. The Court strives to separate "the lands that the Trail traverses" from "the Trail itself," reasoning that the Trail is simply an "easement," "not land."'\n\nBecause today's Court condones the placement of a pipeline that subverts the plain text of the statutes governing the Appalachian Trail, I respectfully dissent.	41
102	MAJORITY	"This Court declines to resolve other matters raised by the parties outside the question presented. But having decided that punitive damages are permissible for federal claims and that the reasons the court of appeals offered for its contrary decision were mistaken, it follows that the court of appeals must also reconsider its decision concerning the availability of punitive damages for claims proceeding under state law"	42
105	MAJORITY	Courts can, and sometimes do, dismiss frivolous claims without prejudice. This preserves the right to appeal on the claim if the appellant can make a non-frivolous argument. However, that dismissal still counts against the number of strikes for in forma pauperis appeals, and once three strikes are accumulated, the appellant is barred from further in forma pauperis appeals. 	44
106	MAJORITY	The Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (FARRA) "preclude[s] judicial review of factual challenges only to final orders of removal."\n\nA Convention Against Torture (CAT) order is not a final order of removal because it does not effect the validity of a final order of removal. Factual challenges to CAT orders are therefore allowed if there is substantial evidence for review. 	45
107	DISSENT	The case turns on the plain meaning of the clause: "all questions of law or fact... arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien shall be consolidated and available only in judicial review of a final order under this section."\n\nThe majority claims that CAT orders cannot be consolidated into the final order, but CAT orders should be included by the "zipper clause" and fall under this section. Therefore, being part of the final order, are excluded from judicial review under FARRA if the defendant commits a crime of moral turpitude, which is alleged in this case.	45
108	MAJORITY	An applicant may avoid expedited removal by demonstrating a credible fear of persecution under asylum law. The credible fear test is conducted by an asylum officer and reviewed by a supervisor. IIRIRA limits the review a federal court has on this process.\n\nArticle I of the constitution has the suspension clause which states: "“[t]he Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases\nof Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it." This clause protects the writ as understood in 1789.\n\n"Respondent does not seek release from custody, but an additional opportunity to obtain asylum. His claims therefore fall outside the scope of the writ as it existed\nwhen the Constitution was adopted."\n\nThis is not a violation of due process because "an alien in respondent’s position, has only those rights regarding admission that Congress has provided by statute."	46
109	CONCURRENCE	Habeas Corpus is enshrined in the constitution as a substantive right. This understanding comes largely form English common law, where from time to time, parliament would suspend habeas corpus and allow for the detention of suspicious persons.\n\nBy this understanding, IIRIRA does not suspend Habeas Corpus. Suspension was understood to be a writ enabling detention on suspicion of crime without bail or trial. In this case, the detention of an asylum seeker who does not meet the statutory requirements for entry bears no resemblance to suspension of habeas corpus as understood by the founders. 	46
110	CONCUR_JUDGEMENT	In this particular case, the application of IIRIRA does not violate the suspension clause. The court concludes this, but the court should not have gone further. Deciding more broadly that this provision does not violate the suspension clause is unwise, since it raises other questions not before the court in this case.\n\nFor example, as written today, the IIRIRA allows for expedited removal of persons in the country for less than two years. But congress could change that to increase that time period or remove it altogether. The court has not fully considered the ramifications of applying this statute to the suspension clause more broadly before declaring the entire thing constitutionally allowed.	46
111	DISSENT	The court purges an entire class of legal challenges from executive habeas review "no matter whether the denial is arbitrary or irrational or contrary to governing law."\n\n"Making matters worse, the Court holds that the Constitution’s due process protections do not extend to noncitizens like respondent... In doing so, the Court upends settled constitutional law and paves the way toward transforming already summary expedited removal proceedings into arbitrary administrative adjudications."	46
112	MAJORITY	Equitable relief historically excludes punitive sanctions.  To avoid punitive damages disgorgement of funds must be restricted to the net profits under joint and severable liability theory.\n\n"Petitioners briefly claim that their disgorgement award crosses the bounds of traditional equity practice by failing to return funds to victims, imposing joint-and-several liability, and declining to deduct business expenses from the award. Because the parties did not fully brief these narrower questions, the Court does not decide them here."\n\nCourts may not disgorge funds spent on legitimate business expenses, but the district court did not conclude which expenses may or may not have been legitimate.\n\n"On remand, the lower courts should examine whether including such expenses in a profits-based remedy is consistent with the equitable principles"	47
113	DISSENT	Disgorgement cannot be rewarded for equitable relief. "That statute authorizes the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to seek only 'equitable relief that may be appropriate or necessary for the\nbenefit of investors,' and disgorgement is not a traditional equitable remedy."\n\n"The definition of disgorgement, after today’s decision, is a remedy that compels each defendant to pay his profits (and sometimes, though it is not clear when, all of his codefendants’ profits) to a third-party Government agency (which sometimes, though it is not clear when, passes the money on to victims). This remedy has no basis in historical practice"	47
114	MAJORITY	"The robocall restriction, with the government-debt exception, is content based because it favors speech made for the purpose of collecting government debt over political and other speech."\n\nThe Free Speech Clause provides that government generally “has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content.”	54
115	CONCURRENCE	"The 2015 government-debt exception is severable from the underlying 1991 robocall restriction. The TCPA is part of the Communications Act, which has contained an express severability clause since 1934. Even if that clause did not apply to the exception, the presumption of severability would still apply."	54
117	CONCUR_JUDGEMENT	Concur in judgement with respect to severability	54
118	DISSENT	The government debt exception does not violate the first amendment. "This case primarily involves commercial regulation—namely, debt collection. And, in my view, there is no basis here to apply strict scrutiny based on content-discrimination."\n\nThe first amendment is designed to protect the marketplace of ideas, to prevent the government for crushing dissenting opinions. The regulation of debt collection has nothing to do with the marketplace ideas.\n\n"To reflexively treat all content-based distinctions as subject to strict scrutiny regardless of context or practical effect is to engage in an analysis untethered from the First Amendment’s objectives."	54
119	DISSENT_JUDGEMENT	The entire robocall restriction fails strict scrutiny because it is a government restriction on content.  "The statute fails strict scrutiny because the government offers no compelling justification for its prohibition against the plaintiffs’ political speech. In fact, the government does not dispute that, if strict scrutiny\napplies, its law must fall."	54
120	DISSENT_JUDGEMENT	With a constitutional violation proven, the court should issue a remedy. The plurality opinion invokes severability doctrine. But severing the government debt exemption fails to provide any remedy.\n\n"Somehow, in the name of vindicating the First Amendment, our remedial course today leads to the unlikely result that not a single person will be allowed to speak more freely and, instead, more speech will be banned."\n\nThe exemption in this case should not be severed. But the court should more broadly reconsider its severability doctrine. 	54
116	CONCUR_JUDGEMENT	"I agree with much of the partial dissent’s explanation that strict scrutiny should not apply to all content-based distinctions... In my view, however, the government-debt exception still fails intermediate scrutiny because it is not 'narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest.'"\n\nAgree that the offending provision is severable. 	54
121	MAJORITY	A rule that would make a generic term combined with a generic internet domain name suffix (such as .com) is not supported by trademark law or the US PTO past practices. 	49
122	CONCURRENCE	Agree with the majority in not creating a per se rule to ban generic.com trademarks. However, courts should take into consideration a broad variety of sources to determine if the whole "generic.com" mark has meaning to consumers.\n\nConsumer surveys may be limited or methodologically biases, and therefore should not be the only evidence of meaning. "Dictionaries, usage by consumers and competitors, and any other source of evidence bearing on how consumers perceive a term's meaning may also inform whether a mark is generic or descriptive"\n\nBooking.com may in fact be a term with meaning to consumers under the above definition, and the district court may have erred in ruling otherwise, but that question is not before this court.	49
123	DISSENT	"Trademark law does not protect generic terms, meaning terms that do no more than name the product or service itself. This principle preserves the linguistic commons by preventing one producer from appropriating to its own exclusive use a term needed by others to describe their goods or services. Today, the Court holds that the addition of '.com' to an otherwise generic term, such as 'booking,' can yield a protectable trademark. Because I believe this result is inconsistent with trademark principles and sound trademark policy, I respectfully dissent."	49
125	CONCURRENCE	Agree that this policy does not violate the first amendment for foreign affiliated NGOs, but it shouldn't violate the first amendment for US based NGOs either (disagrees with the courts majority in Agency for Int'l Development v. Alliance for Open Society Int'l, Inc (2013)\n\nThe policy does not violate the first amendment because it does not compel speech. It is reasonable for the government to restrict who gets funding to organizations who agree with the governments mission. 	50
126	DISSENT	"The Court, in my view, asks the wrong question and gives the wrong answer. This case is not about the First Amendment rights of foreign organizations. It is about—and has always been about—the First Amendment rights of American organizations."\n\nThe last time we heard this case, the court ruled that American organizations have a right to speak freely, both at home and abroad, and the government cannot require them to distort their speech.\n\nIn this case, the court should have held that American organizations "enjoy that same constitutional protection against government-compelled distortion when they speak through clearly identified affiliates that have been incorporated overseas."	50
127	MAJORITY	The constitution gives states the power to appoint electors to the electoral college in the manner they choose, and that can include conditioning appointment on, for example, a pledge to support the party's nominee.\n\n"Article II includes only the instruction to each State to appoint electors, and the Twelfth Amendment only sets out the electors' voting procedures." No language about elector discretion made it into the constitution.	55
128	CONCUR_JUDGEMENT	When the constitution is silent, the power rests in the states or the people. The majority is correct in allowing states the broad power over appointing electors, but this is derived from the 10th amendment.	55
129	PER_CURIUM	The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit is reversed for the reasons stated in Chiafalo v. Washington.	56
130	CONCUR_JUDGEMENT	JUSTICE THOMAS concurs in the judgment for the reasons stated in his separate opinion in Chiafalo v. Washington	56
131	MAJORITY	"Courts are bound to stay out of employment disputes involving those holding certain important positions with churches and other religious institutions."\n\n"There is abundant record evidence that [the teachers] performed vital religious duties, such as educating their students in the Catholic faith and guiding their students to live their lives in accordance with that faith. Their titles did not include the term 'minister' and they had less formal religious training... but their core responsibilities were essentially the same."	52
132	CONCURRENCE	Join the majority in full. However, courts should defer to religious organizations on what qualifies as a minister, rather than trying to impose some sort of test.	52
124	MAJORITY	"Foreign organizations operating abroad do not possess rights under the U. S. Constitution." Trying to distinguish between foreign organizations that are affiliated with US organizations would enmesh the court in a difficult line drawing exercise.\n\n"As a matter of American corporate law, separately incorporated organizations are separate legal units with distinct legal rights and obligations."	50
161	DISSENT	"I agree with the majority that the President is not entitled to absolute immunity from issuance of the subpoena. But he may be entitled to relief against its enforcement. I therefore agree with the President that the proper course is to vacate and remand." If the president can show that enforcement of the subpoena would hinder his official duties, he should be able to block enforcement of that subpoena.	58
133	DISSENT	"In the Court's view, because the employees taught short religion modules at Catholic elementary schools, they were "ministers" of the Catholic faith and thus could be fired for any reason, whether religious or nonreligious, benign or bigoted, without legal recourse. The Court reaches this result even though the teachers taught primarily secular subjects, lacked substantial religious titles and training, and were not even required to be Catholic."\n\nThis simplistic approach has no basis in law and strips teachers of age and disability protections (in these cases, one teacher was fired for having breast cancer, the other was fired for being elderly).  	52
134	MAJORITY	"Here, the application of Montana's no-aid provision excludes religious schools from public benefits solely because of religious status. As a result, strict scrutiny applies."\n\nTo satisfy strict scrutiny, the government would need to show a compelling interest in restricting free exercise of religion. The desire to create a more restrictive separation of church and state than the US Constitution does not satisfy this requirement. \n\nThrowing out the entire tax credit program is not necessary, since by allowing all schools, including religious schools, and parents who want to send children to these schools the ability to participate would satisfy the free exercise clause.	40
135	CONCURRENCE	Agree with the majority and write "separately to explain how this Court's interpretation of the Establishment Clause continues to hamper free exercise rights."\n\nMontana was led astray by an erroneous interpretation of the establishment clause that requires any law to treat all religions equally and to treat non-religion as a religion. This is  unmoored from the understanding of establishment at the time of the constitution's writing, which would have involved "coercion of religious orthodoxy and of financial support by force of law and threat of penalty."\n\nBecause this court has incorrectly interpreted the establishment clause so broadly, lower courts such as Montana believe they must remain completely neutral with regards to religion, but that is not the case. They should be free to express explicit preference for certain religions in law without that counting as "establishing" a religion.	40
136	CONCURRENCE	Earlier this term this court decided in Ramos v. Louisiana that Louisiana's non-unanimous jury law violated the sixth amendment because it was adopted for racially discriminatory purposes. "I argued in dissent that this original motivation, though deplorable, had no bearing on the laws' constitutionality because such laws can be adopted for non-discriminatory reasons."\n\nHowever, because Ramos is now precedent, that means we should consider discriminatory intent as part of our analysis. Montana's constitution included these restrictions on funding to religious schools explicitly because of anti-catholic bigotry. \n\n"The program helped parents of modest means do what more affluent parents can do: send their children to a school of their choice." 	40
137	CONCURRENCE	The court draws a distinction between religious status and religious use, but I'm not sure such as distinction is warranted in this case (or in the controlling precedent, Trinity Lutherin). \n\n"Maybe it's possible to describe what happened here as status-based discrimination. But it seems equally, and maybe more, natural to say that the State's discrimination focused on what religious parents and schools do—teach religion. Nor are the line-drawing challenges here unique; they have arisen before and will again."\n\nEither way, the first amendment does not care, and neither should the court.	40
138	DISSENT	The state courts decision to strike down the tuition aid law in its entirety does not discriminate based on religion. Neither religions schools nor non-religious schools would be able to use the program. "This Court has consistently refused to treat neutral government action as unconstitutional solely because it fails to benefit religious exercise."\n\nThis court finds a restriction to the free exercise of religion where none exists. The Montana Supreme Court did not rule that funding could not go to religious schools and therefore the whole law was struck down. Instead, rather than re-write the law from the bench, it found the law was incompatible with the Montana constitution and threw the whole thing out.\n\nThe majority does what the Montana court refused to by separating the Montana ruling into two parts, striking down the first part, and then ignoring the second. But the court should only have looked at the Montana decision as a whole.	40
139	DISSENT	"The inherent tension between the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses means, however, that the 'course of constitutional neutrality in this area cannot be an absolutely straight line.'"\n\n"It may be that, under our precedents, the Establishment Clause does not forbid Montana to subsidize the education of petitioners' children. But, the question here is whether the Free Exercise Clause requires it to do so. The majority believes that the answer to that question is 'yes.'" I disagree.\n\nThis case does not involve a status based claim. The schools are not a party to the lawsuit. Instead, it is parents who contend that not getting extra state funds to send their children to religious schools violates their free exercise. 	40
140	DISSENT	Having stated my view that the establishment clause might permit funding religious schools but does not require it, and since Montana does not allow the funds to be used this way, this court should affirm that.\n\n"the majority is wrong to replace the flexible, context-specific approach of our precedents with a test of "strict" or "rigorous" scrutiny. And it is wrong to imply that courts should use that same heightened scrutiny whenever a government benefit is at issue."\n\nThe majority's approach will not disentangle the court from future disputes, but rather it will place the court directly in the middle of disputes of government benefit programs by no longer allowing deference to the state in question, and instead applying a new strict scrutiny not supported by prior precedent.	40
141	DISSENT	The court fails to heed Article III powers in this case by deciding an issue not raised by the petitioners. Rather than reviewing the ruling of the Montana Supreme Court, which struck down the aid law in its entirety, the court instead decides to review whether a long held part of the Montana Constitution is unconstitutional under the free exercise clause. \n\n"Not only is the Court wrong to decide this case at all, it decides it wrongly." This ruling "weakens this country's longstanding commitment to a separation of church and state beneficial to both."\n\n"Today's ruling is perverse. Without any need or power to do so, the Court appears to require a State to reinstate a tax-credit program that the Constitution did not demand in the first place.... Today's Court rejects the Religion Clauses' balanced values in favor of a new theory of free exercise, and it does so only by setting aside well-established judicial constraints." 	40
142	MAJORITY	Under the constitutional standards set up in Planned Parenthood v. Casey and Whole Woman's Health, this provision violates the constitution.\n\nThe Fifth Circuit, on appeal of the district court, disagreed with the findings of fact. However findings of fact "must not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and the reviewing court must give due regard to the trial court's opportunity to judge the witnesses' credibility."\n\n"In light of the record, the District Court's significant factual findings—both as to burdens and as to benefits—have ample evidentiary support and are not 'clearly erroneous.'"\n\nThe burden placed on those seeking abortions in this case is nearly identical to that in Whole Woman's health, and stare decisis demands that this case be controlled by that decision.	48
143	CONCUR_JUDGEMENT	"I joined the dissent in Whole Woman's Health and continue to believe that the case was wrongly decided. The question today however is not whether Whole Woman's Health was right or wrong, but whether to adhere to it in deciding the present case."\n\n"The legal doctrine of stare decisis requires us, absent special circumstances, to treat like cases alike. The Louisiana law imposes a burden on access to abortion just as severe as that imposed by the Texas law, for the same reasons. Therefore Louisiana's law cannot stand under our precedents."	48
144	DISSENT	"As is often the case with legal challenges to abortion regulations, this suit was brought by abortionists and abortion clinics. Their sole claim before this Court is that Louisiana's law violates the purported substantive due process right of a woman to abort her unborn child. But they concede that this right does not belong to them, and they seek to vindicate no private rights of their own. Under a proper understanding of Article III, these plaintiffs lack standing to invoke our jurisdiction"\n\n"Our abortion precedents are grievously wrong and should be overruled. Because we have neither jurisdiction nor constitutional authority to declare Louisiana's duly enacted law unconstitutional, I respectfully dissent."	48
145	DISSENT	An abortion law must create an undo burden on women to be struck down. The precedent in Whole Woman's Health should be overruled insofar as it misinterprets Casey. This original undo burden test in Casey should be reinstated until the court is asked to review Casey (which LA does not ask in this case).\n\nThe majority applies the balancing test in Whole Woman's Health, but contrary to the findings of the plurality opinion, there are legitimate reasons to require admitting privileges to hospitals for abortion providers. Hospitals add value by looking beyond the existence of a medical license, and the additional review process serves to deter malpractice.\n\nThe majority also misuses Stare Decisis. While the statutes from TX and LA are similar, the cases are very different. In Whole Woman's the challenge was post enactment of the law where harm could be shown. But in this case, the law has not gone into effect, so the petitioners cannot show the law produces an undo burden.	48
146	DISSENT	June Medical should not be allowed to petition on behalf of its clients. Those whose rights are harmed must be the ones to bring the case. It is true that LA did not raise an objection to June Medical's standing, but this court can review matters of law not addressed in the lower court so long as the lower courts have passed on the question.\n\nThere is a conflict of interest between the abortion provider and those seeking abortion services as abortion providers want to reduce regulation but their clients may want increased medical safety standards. That conflict should be sufficient to prevent June Medical from making the case on their client's behalf. 	48
147	DISSENT	The judicial process should be constrained by rules, rules which this court ignores one after the other.\n\nThe court substitutes its own fact-finding judgement to that of the legislature in determining that the costs of the rule outweigh the benefits.\n\nThis court allowed third party standing to abortion providers where it clearly should not have.\n\nFacial challenges to laws should be especially difficult since the harms are not established. The court abandons its usual caution to reach an over-broad ruling.\n\nFact finding should be dependent on the specific case, but he majority substitutes fact finding from Whole Woman's Health treating factual questions as if they were legal ones. \n\nThe legal standard established here as a sort of balancing act this court generally avoids, forcing lower courts to do complex cost benefit guesswork.\n\nArriving at todays result, the majority had to brush aside all these established rules to arrive at a decision unconstrained by the courts tradition of neutrality. 	48
148	DISSENT	It appears that there is a five justice majority to reject the cost benefit analysis test introduced in Whole Woman's Health. However, a different 5 justice majority finds this law unconstitutional because it would restrict access to abortion to the same degree as TX in Whole Woman's Health.\n\nThe second conclusion is wrong. This case should be remanded for further fact finding since it cannot be proven that sufficient abortion clinics would be forced to close and new clinics would not be able to open. \n\nOn remand, the district court may address, for the first time, the new issues raised as to third party standing, but it would be inappropriate for this court to address this question at this time. 	48
149	MAJORITY	The ACA states "that group health plans must provide women with 'preventive care and screenings... as provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by [HRSA].'" This gives sweeping authority to Health Resources and Services Administration to create the rule that requires contraceptive coverage, but also to create exemptions to that rule.\n\nThe petitioners state that the IFR was invalid under the APA because HRSA did not properly post a notice for comment and that they didn't keep an open mind in the rule-making process. This interim final rule [IFR] that grants the exemptions is valid under the Administrative Procedures Act. The IFR went through all the necessary steps and checked all the correct boxes. The open mind requirement does not exist in the text of the APA.	57
150	CONCURRENCE	Agree with the majority in full. The court today rejects challenges that the IFR didn't follow the APA due to the comment period. However, on remand, the challengers are almost certain to raise a new claim, that the IFR violates the APA because it is arbitrary and capricious.\n\nThe court desires not to decide more than the questions presented to it, but under the circumstances, I would also decide that RFRA compels an exemption such as the one in the IFR, and therefore the IFR cannot be arbitrary and capricious. 	57
160	CONCUR_JUDGEMENT	While this court correctly upholds the principle that no one is above the law, Article II does treat the president as a special case. There are conflicting requirements between the state in prosecuting criminal investigations and the Article II powers of executing the functions of the presidency.\n\nIn US v. Nixon, the court required demonstration of a specific need for documents subpoenaed. The majority does not apply Nixon to this case, however the the standard set out in Nixon, although it applied in a different Article II context, is the best precedent we have for addressing the conflict in this case.\n\nI agree with the majority that the case should be remanded for further arguments. I also agree that the president does not have absolute immunity from state criminal subpoenas. 	58
173	CONCURRENCE	The governor is arbitrarily choosing essential business exempt from restrictions in a non-neutral way disfavoring religious organizations. If people may gather in liquor stores and bike shops, no reason exists to deny access to churches and synagogs.\n\nThe courts need to stop applying Chief Justice Robert's non binding concurrence in South Bay that defers to executive authority on pandemic restrictions. "We may not shelter in place when the Constitution is under attack."\n\nNew York did modify their executive action before this case came to the Supreme Court, but that is not sufficient reason not to make a ruling now, since it takes weeks for the plaintiffs to get a hearing and injunctive relief.	106
151	CONCUR_JUDGEMENT	Agree with the majorities judgement, but for different reasons. Separately, it is not clear that the IFR could survive a challenge to an administrative requirement for reasoned decision making (arbitrary and capricious). That is for the lower courts to address on remand.\n\nBoth the majority and the dissent disagree on the scope of HRSA's power to differentiate within health plans, each drawing a different conclusion from the text of the ACA. "Try as I might, I do not find that kind of clarity in the statute."\n\nChevron deference was built for cases like this. "Chevron instructs that a court facing statutory ambiguity should accede to a reasonable interpretation by the implementing agency." The departments have adopted the majority's reading of the statute, and the court should give deference to that interpretation as the agency is the more politically accountable actor.	57
152	DISSENT	The court should take a balanced approach to religious freedom where it does not allow the rights of some to overwrite the rights of others who do not share the same beliefs. "Today, for the first time, the Court casts totally aside countervailing rights and interests in its zeal to secure religious rights to the nth degree."\n\n"Destructive of the Women's Health Amendment, this Court leaves women workers to fend for themselves, to seek contraceptive coverage from sources other than their employer's insurer, and, absent another available source of funding, to pay for contraceptive services out of their own pockets." Neither the Free Exercise Clause nor RFRA call for such an imbalanced result.\n\n"I therefore dissent from the Court's judgment, under which, as the Government estimates, between 70,500 and 126,400 women would immediately lose access to no-cost contraceptive services."	57
153	MAJORITY	In a treaty signed in 1833, congress granted lands to the Creek Nation "so long as they shall exist as a nation, and continue to occupy the country hereby assigned to them." An additional treaty in 1856 promised that “no portion” of Creek lands "would ever be embraced or included within, or annexed to, any Territory or State." \n\n"Congress has since broken more than a few promises to the Tribe. Nevertheless, the Creek Reservation persists today." Once a reservation is established, only congress can revoke it. The revocation must be an explicit expression of congressional intent. No such action by congress has occurred.\n\n"This Court is aware of the potential for cost and conflict around jurisdictional boundaries. But Oklahoma and its tribes have proven time and again that they can work successfully together as partners, and Congress remains free to supplement its statutory directions about the lands in question at any time. "\n	53
154	DISSENT	"Today, the Court holds that Oklahoma lacked jurisdiction to prosecute McGirt—on the improbable ground that, unbeknownst to anyone for the past century, a huge swathe of Oklahoma is actually a Creek Indian reservation, on which the State may not prosecute serious crimes committed by Indians like McGirt." The court does not just "discover" this Creek reservation, but the reasoning would also portend that here are 4 more such reservations in Oklahoma.\n\nThis ruling will destabilize the government of easter OK, and cause perhaps thousands of criminal convictions to be overturned. \n\nThe court should reach a conclusion about the status of the reservations by determining if the issue is "well settled"... looking at statutes passed by congress leading up to Oklahoma statehood and contemporaneous and subsequent understanding of the reservation. Applying this more appropriate application of law would conclude that no reservation exists. 	53
155	DISSENT	"I agree with The Chief Justice that the former Creek Nation Reservation was disestablished at statehood and Oklahoma therefore has jurisdiction to prosecute petitioner for sexually assaulting his wife’s granddaughter.... I write separately to note an additional defect in the Court’s decision: It reverses a state court judgment that it has no jurisdiction to review."\n\nThe question of the jurisdiction of the reservation was barred under state law because the question was “not raised previously on direct appeal.” The state is within its rights to enforce such a provision and such an enforcement should not be reviewable by federal courts.\n\nThe Oklahoma decision briefly mentions Sharp v. Murphy, a case where this court granted Certiori but is not yet final. Such a brief mention is not sufficient to say Oklahoma addressed the merits of Murphy, and so there is no federal question on which this case could be appealed.\n\n	53
156	MAJORITY	Issuing a subpoena under legislative authority is subject to some limitations. The subpoena must serve a legitimate legislative purpose, and cannot be for the purpose of law enforcement, as that power is restricted to the executive branch.\n\nThe president is wrong to apply the same deference in executive privilege to a case involving non privileged private documents. Congress' approach fails to take into account the separation of powers concerns.\n\nOn remand, courts should consider several factors in determining if the subpoena is valid. There should be no other way to get the information beyond the private documents, congress must explicitly establish a legislative purpose, and the courts must assess the burdens imposed on the president by the subpoena.	51
157	DISSENT	"I would hold that Congress has no power to issue a legislative subpoena for private, nonofficial documents—whether they belong to the President or not. Congress may be able to obtain these documents as part of an investigation of the President, but  to do so, it must proceed under the impeachment power."	51
158	DISSENT	Legislative subpoenas for private documents should not be categorically barred, as Thomas suggests, but a subpoena for the president's private documents is inherently suspicious. "Congress should be required to make more than a perfunctory showing that it is seeking the documents for a legitimate legislative purpose and not for the purpose of exposing supposed Presidential wrongdoing."\n\nThe Court provides some guidelines for the lower courts to consider when evaluating the subpoena, but I don't think these guidelines can be adequately considered until The House is required to show explicitly why these documents are required and for what purpose. "Because I find the terms of the Court's remand inadequate, I must respectfully dissent."	51
159	MAJORITY	Precedent involving subpoenas for sitting presidents go back to United States v. Burr in 1807, which ruled that the president must turn over subpoenaed documents. This was upheld time and again including in US v. Nixon (1974). These were all federal subpoenas, so the president argues in this case that he need not comply with state subpoenas. \n\nAlthough the president cannot be treated as an ordinary individual involving official documents, the president has no such protections for his private documents. "Absent a need to protect the Executive, the public interest in fair and effective law enforcement cuts in favor of comprehensive access to evidence."\n\nOn remand the president could challenge the subpoenas on the grounds that compliance would hinder his official duties, but there is no heightened standard to be applied under the supremacy clause. 	58
162	DISSENT	The court does not try to decide if state prosecutors have the authority to bring criminal charges against a sitting president, but that question is paramount. If the answer is no, then the obvious question becomes what investigative powers are allowed? \n\nFederalism prevents states from interfering with the duties of the federal government. The president is the chief executive, and an intrinsic part of the federal government. A state prosecution violates this core principle of federalism.\n\nThe constitution provides impeachment as a remedy for misbehavior of a president. Imagine a state prosecutor indicting a president. Could the president be denied bail? What about investigative powers; could a wiretap of the president's phone be ordered by a state official?\n\nNo one is above the law, but the consequences of enforcing the law require some procedures to be adjusted at least until the president leaves office. A heightened standard of enforcement of a subpoena is only logical given the nature of the presidency. 	58
163	MAJORITY	Article II vests executive power in the President alone. Other officers may execute that power, but the president reserves the right to supervise, and if necessary, remove those who exercise power on his behalf.\n\nCongress may "give for-cause removal protection to a multimember body of experts who were balanced along partisan lines, appointed to staggered terms, performed only 'quasi-legislative' and 'quasi-judicial functions,' and were said not to exercise any executive power." Such as the FTC.\n\nThe CFPB clearly exercises executive functions, and as such, is not subject to the quasi legislative exemption. Furthermore, with only a single head of the agency, and not a rotating committee, it cannot be said that the structure supports retaining institutional knowledge. The structure is an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers.	59
164	MAJORITY	"Generally speaking, when confronting a constitutional flaw in a statute, we try to limit the solution to the problem, severing any problematic portions while leaving the remainder intact." (Free Enterprise Fund). \n\nThe rest of the Dodd-Frank Act that established the CFBP remains executable and constitutional so long as the offending leadership restriction is removed. Dodd-Frank also contains an express severability clause clearly indicating congresses intent for the rest of the law to survive should the court find one provision unconstitutional.\n\nThe leadership structure is severable, struck down, while the rest of Dodd-Frank remains intact. We remand to decide if the directive issued by the CFPB while under the old leadership structure is properly ratified by a new presidential appointee. 	59
165	DISSENT_JUDGEMENT	This is a restrained approach to the merits and an extreme approach to severability doctrine. I agree with the court that the leadership structure is unconstitutional but I dissent from the plurality finding that this is severable from the rest of the law.\n\nThe court correctly limits the precedent of Humphry's Executor in creating independent agencies. I would go further and eliminate that precedent altogether... all agencies should fall entirely under executive control. \n\nThe constitution does not allow courts to revise statutes, and the severability doctrine is not a power granted to the courts under the constitution. 	59
166	DISSENT_JUDGEMENT	If precedent was a guide to todays decision the court would have allowed the proposed independent structure of CFPB to survive. Time and again the court has upheld independent structures that were agreed on by the legislative and executive branches: FTC, NLRB, The Federal Reserve, etc.\n\nThe constitution grants congress the authority to establish the institutions of American governance, and nothing in it speaks to powers of removal. The constitution leaves disagreements over removal powers to be resolved between Congress and the President.\n\nThe court tries to declare that the CFPB is different, it creates an exception "gerrymandered so the CFPB falls outside" of it. "In second-guessing the political branches, the majority second-guesses as well the wisdom of the Framers and the judgment of history."\n\nI would rule the leadership provision constitutional (and therefore the rest of Dodd-Frank constitutional and there would be no need to address severability).  	59
79	MAJORITY	Respondents claim that rescinding DACA violates the equal protection clause of the fifth amendment. None of the arguments presented make a plausible claim for a fifth amendment violation, and fails to show an inference that the rescission was motivated by animus.	16
167	PER_CURIUM	"We think that the Fifth Circuit’s interpretation of state law is too uncertain a premise on which to address the question presented. The constitutional issue, though undeniably important, is implicated only if Louisiana law permits recovery under these circumstances in the first place."\n\nLA rules allow, in the absence of clear controlling precedent, for the state supreme court to certify questions of LA law. Certification would ensure that any conflict between state law and the first amendment is real and not hypothetical.\n\n"We conclude that the Fifth Circuit should not have ventured into so uncertain an area of tort law—one laden with value judgments and fraught with implications for First Amendment rights—\nwithout first seeking guidance on potentially controlling Louisiana law from the Louisiana Supreme Court."	100
168	DISSENT	Dissent without comment	100
169	PER_CURIUM	Taylor was confined to a cell coated in feces, then moved to a cell with a blocked sewage system and no bed or clothes, forcing him to sleep naked in sewage.\n\n"Confronted with the particularly egregious facts of this case, any reasonable officer should have realized that Taylor’s conditions of confinement offended the Constitution. We therefore grant Taylor’s petition for a writ of certiorari, vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion."	101
170	CONCUR_JUDGEMENT	The court should not have granted this case as it is not reviewing the matter of law of Qualified Immunity, but merely the judgement of the lower court on how it should be applied.\n\nSince the court agreed to hear the case, I agree with the judgement that the circumstances do not warrant qualified immunity.	101
171	DISSENT	Dissent without comment.	101
172	PER_CURIUM	"The applicants have made a strong showing that the challenged restrictions violate 'the minimum requirement of neutrality' to religion." Religious activities cannot be treated more harshly than comparable secular activities. "Essential" services exempt from the restrictions include acupuncture, garages, and camp grounds. Large stores could have hundreds shopping there while churches and synagogs are forced to restrict attendance.\n\n"Members of this Court are not public health experts, and we should respect the judgment of those with special expertise and responsibility in this area. But even in a pandemic, the Constitution cannot be put away and forgotten"	106
185	MAJORITY	Texas requested that New Mexico store water at a facility in NM, with the understanding that the water belonged to Texas. Texas argument that the stored water was not part of Texas' allocation and that they should not be charged for evaporated water is unpersuasive. New Mexico is entitled to delivery credit for all water, including what evaporated.	61
174	CONCURRENCE	The Injunction is warranted because New York's severe caps on religious attendance likely violate the constitution. The strict numerical caps apply even for large churches where distancing could be possible with greater numbers.\n\nThe state points out that some secular business are similarly restricted, such as movie theaters. But that is not sufficient. The state has created a favored group of secular business that includes big box stores and hardware stores and it bears the burden of showing why religious groups are treated less favorably.\n\nA pandemic is raging and could get worse. Deference is owed to state and local officials for measures to prevent the virus. "But judicial deference in an emergency or a crisis does not mean wholesale judicial abdication, especially when important questions of religious discrimination, racial discrimination, free speech, or the like are raised."	106
175	DISSENT	The appellants have already been granted the relief they are seeking. New York has changed the restrictions to be 50% capacity. It's true NY might change these to be more restrictive in the future, but they might not. The court can decide the issue if it arrises. The strict numerical limits may have violated the first amendment, but it is not necessary for the court to address the question at this time.\n\nThe solo concurrence from Justice Gorsuch takes aim at the South Bay concurrence, but it's not clear what was so controversial. "Our constitution principally entrusts the safety and health of the people to the politically accountable officials of the States." The concurrence attempts to read beyond those words to attack meaning that isn't there.\n\n\n	106
176	DISSENT	After receiving testimony and hearing evidence, the district court found that the state's numerical restrictions on religious attendance were “crafted based on science and for epidemiological purposes." Similar secular activities such as concerts and movie theaters were treated more strictly than religious gatherings.\n\nThe district court also found distinctions between essential businesses allowed to remain open and religious gatherings. Most shopping business trips are relatively brief and do not require a lot of shopping, shouting, or singing.\n\nThere is no need for the court to issue an injunction since the fixed capacity limits have already been lifted. Secondly, the scientific community tells us how the virus is spread, and the court should not second guess the facts determined by the lower court based on scientific testimony. Certainly not to clear a high bar required for a preliminary injunction. 	106
177	DISSENT	Today, the court reverses its decisions in previous cases to overrule a health directive. There is no reason for the court to do so, and doing so may exacerbate the nation's suffering.\n\nThe appellants try to argue that religious gatherings hold the same risks as essential businesses, but the district court found otherwise. Justice Gorsuch lists his own examples, but does not try to square that with the medical advice on how COVID is spread: "large groups of people gathering, speaking, and singing in close proximity indoors for extended periods of time."\n\nIn this case, NY treats religious institutions more favorably than comparable secular activity (Gyms, Movie Theaters, Concerts, etc.) which have had to close down entirely.	106
179	CONCURRENCE	Joins the court's opinion in full because it properly applies existing precedent. However, the court should revisit it's jurisprudence on ERISA pre-emption.\n\nThe plain text of ERISA suggests a different interpretation than the court has taken. The act implies pre-emption if the ERISA provisions govern the same matter as the state law AND the state law has a meaningful relationship with the ERISA plan. Both conditions must be met for pre-emption.\n\nOur precedents have veered away from the text, instead looking at the objectives of ERISA and pre-empting state laws that conflict with those objectives. Stare Decisis concerns should not prevent the court from revisiting the issue in a way that is consistent with a text based approach.	62
180	MAJORITY	The Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)  has no statute of limitations for crimes carrying the death penalty, and a 5 year statute of limitations otherwise. Rape is listed as a capital crime punishable by death. The Supreme Court has since disallowed capital punishment for rape, but the original intent in UCMJ was to have no statute of limitations for rape.\n\nThe ends served by a statute of limitations are different than those of the eight amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment, so striking down the capital sentence under the eighth amendment does not intuitively imply re-examining the statute of limitations.	66
181	CONCURRENCE	"I continue to think this Court lacks jurisdiction to hear appeals directly from the CAAF [Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces]. But a majority of the Court believes we have jurisdiction, and I agree with the Court’s decision on the merits. I therefore join the Court’s opinion."	66
182	MAJORITY	"Because Adams has not shown that he was 'able and ready' to apply for a judicial vacancy in the imminent future, he has failed to show a 'personal,' 'concrete,' and \n'imminent' injury necessary for Article III standing."\n\n"Adams must at least show that he is likely to apply to become a judge in the reasonably foreseeable future, if he were not barred because of political affiliation." His only supporting evidence are statements that he would like to apply to be a judge on one of Delaware's 5 courts.\n\nAn abstract general grievance does not represent an actual desire to become a judge and is not sufficient to show actual harm, and therefore standing.	60
183	CONCURRENCE	Since the constitutional issue is likely to come before the court again, there are two important considerations.\n\nFirst, a "bare majority" requirement, which limits how many seats one party can control is different than a requirement that precludes anyone not part of one of the two major parties.\n\nSecond, there would be a question of whether Delaware's major party and bare majority requirements are severable from each other. \n\nFederal courts are not the best venue to decide this question, so Delaware should consider getting certification from the State Supreme Court.	60
184	MAJORITY	According the the text of RFRA, relief that can be expressed through an official of the United States counts as relief against the government. \n\nRFRA's language on "appropriate relief" is open ended and such language has long included monetary relief. Since this case does not involve sovereign immunity that relief can be achieved through the individual agents acting "under color of law".	63
186	CONCUR_JUDGEMENT	In this case, New Mexico's filing is allowed because the deadline was missed by the appointed River Master and Texas acquiesced to the delay. In the future, all parties should do better to hit their appropriate deadlines.\n\n"On the question whether the River Master properly allocated the water that evaporated, I would vacate and remand, with instructions to the River Master to redo his analysis in accordance with the relevant terms of the amended decree and the manual." \n\nIt's possible that Texas only had New Mexico store the water because it was required by the Federal Bureau of Reclamation. If so, Texas' request for storage should be read as part of this larger picture. \n\nAdditionally, the River Master's amendment to the deadlines imposed is invalid.	61
187	PER_CURIUM	For a case to be heard by the court, it must have Article III standing. The case should not be dependent on "contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all."\n\nThis case has many contingencies and speculation. The president has expressed a desire to exclude aliens without lawful status, but  Any prediction how the Executive Branch might eventually implement this general statement of policy is 'no more than conjecture' at this time."\n\n"The judgment of the District Court is vacated, and the case is remanded with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction."	99
188	DISSENT	"The Government does not deny that, if carried out, the policy will harm the plaintiffs. Nor does it deny that it will implement that policy imminently (to the extent it is able to do so). Under a straightforward application of our precedents, the plaintiffs have standing to sue"\n\nNot only is the question ripe for judicial consideration, but the plaintiffs should prevail on the merits. Excluding aliens without lawful status would violate the plain language of the governing statute and decades of historical practice.\n\nWaiting to adjudicate the issue until after the president submits his tabulation to congress risks costly delays in apportionment. 	99
189	MAJORITY	"The mere retention of estate property... does not violate... the bankruptcy code." Bankruptcy operates as a "stay of any act to exercise control" over disputed property. The natural reading is that this would prevent changes to the status quo. The history of the bankruptcy code confirms this reading.\n\nThis case does not decide how turnover obligation operates, or address any other subsections of the code.	67
190	CONCURRENCE	Concur with the majority because, as written, the "exercise control of" section does not cover property lawfully sized before the declaration of bankruptcy. \n\nBut "the Court has not decided whether and when other provisions may require a creditor to return a debtor’s property." The city's conduct may well have violated multiple other sections of bankruptcy law.	67
191	MAJORITY	"The Board’s refusal to reopen a prior benefits determination is subject to judicial review" as it is a final decision. Ambiguities in what constitutes a final decision must be decided in favor of Salinas.\n\n"The Board’s decision to grant or deny reopening is ultimately discretionary, however, and therefore subject to reversal only for abuse of discretion"\n\nThe case is remanded back to the lower courts.	71
192	DISSENT	There is a distinction between Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act [RUIA]. and the Railroad Retirement Act. The majority may be correctly interpreting the rules for judicial review for RUIA, but his case is about the RRA.\n\nNo one has a "right" to reopen a closed decision. The fact that this is not a right conflicts with the 3 step test for judicial review outlined in RRA. The majority instead uses the structures for review the court uses for administrative decisions, but that is a default rule and should be superseded by RRA.\n\n"Because the Board’s decision below did not determine any right or liability, the RRA does not provide for judicial review."	71
193	MAJORITY	International law is developed around relationships between countries and often does not consider individual rights. The domestic takings provisions are fairly intentional and most recently added to FSIA in the 1960s.\n\nThere are many exceptions to foreign sovereign immunity, but none of them apply in this case. Taking of property from people within the country does not violate international laws as understood in FSIA. The case is remanded for other arguments.\n\n"This Court does not address... the heirs’ alternative argument that the sale of the Welfenschatz is not subject to the domestic takings rule because the consortium members were not German nationals at the time of the transaction."	81
194	PER_CURIUM	"The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the decision in Federal Republic of Germany v. Philipp"	80
195	MAJORITY	The Judgement bar requires a final judgment on the merits of the case. The district courts ruling dismissing the FTCA case is a merits decision and triggers the judgement bar.\n\nA separate Bivens claim cannot be heard because the merits were already reached in the district courts dismissal.	75
196	CONCURRENCE	Agree that the district courts dismissal of the FTCA claim reaches the merits. "Importantly, the Court does not today decide whether an order resolving the merits of an FTCA claim precludes other claims arising out of the same subject matter in the same suit. Although the parties briefed the issue, it was not the basis of the lower court’s decision."\n\nThis is an issue that has arguments and counter arguments and will need further clarification in a future case.	75
197	MAJORITY	"The deliberative process privilege shields from disclosure documents reflecting advisory opinions and deliberations comprising the process by which the Government formulates decisions and policies"\n\nThe drafts were subject to change and had no legal consequences. Decision makers did not approve the drafts or send them to the EPA. "While the drafts may have had the practical effect of provoking EPA to revise its rule, the privilege applies because the Services did not treat the drafts as final."	70
198	DISSENT	The term "draft" here is misleading. Final opinions are obviously not exempt from FIOA requests. And deliberative draft documents are clearly protected by the deliberative process exception. In the middle, is the Draft Biological Opinion in this case.\n\n"In the context before us, the Services’ Draft Biological Opinions reflect 'final' decisions regarding the 'jeopardy' the EPA’s then-proposed actions would have caused."\n\nThis document sets forth the final services view and is not deliberative, and therefore should not be covered by the deliberative process privilege.	70
223	MAJORITY	Agency level adjudication proceedings are generally ill equipped to address structural constitutional challenges. It doesn't make sense to raise issues before a body that does not have the power to address the issues or provide relief for them.\n\nBecause it makes little sense to raise the constitutional issue of the appointments clause before the ALJs that cannot provide relief for that issue, it should be reserved and permitted to be raised in federal court.	102
199	MAJORITY	"The INA squarely places the burden of proof on the alien to prove eligibility for relief from removal." \n\nPereida attempts a categorical approach to show that the broad crime he was convicted under, which contains some sections that count as crimes of moral turpitude and some that do not, can be divided to show he did not engage in COMT. This is a question of historical fact and all burden falls on Pereida. The lower court holds that Pereida failed to meet this bar.\n\n"It is not this Court’s place to choose among competing policy arguments. Congress was entitled to conclude that uncertainty about an alien’s prior conviction should not redound to his benefit."	69
200	DISSENT	This case is not about where the burden of proof falls, but rather in the application fo the categorical approach for determining the nature of the crime.\n\n"The relevant documents in this case do not show that the previous conviction at issue necessarily was for a crime involving moral turpitude. Hence, applying the categorical approach, it was not. That should be the end of the case."\n\nCongress makes it clear that the categorical approach should be applied when state crime definitions do not align with definitions in the INA. Our precedents show how that approach should apply to cases like this one. Since the majority reaches a different result, I dissent.	69
201	MAJORITY	Article III standing requires a plaintiff to identify an injury and to seek a judgement that will redress that injury.\n\n"Nominal damages are not purely symbolic. They are instead the damages awarded by default until the plaintiff establishes entitlement to some other form of damages. A single dollar often will not provide full redress, but the partial remedy satisfies the redressability requirement."\n\nA contrary ruling would mean that there would be no remedy at all for violations (like voting or due process rights) where there is no easily reducible monetary valuation.\n\nThis doesn't mean that a request for nominal damages alone is sufficient for standing as the plaintiff must also establish particularized injury and cause of action.	88
202	CONCURRENCE	Agree with the majority that a request for nominal damages satisfies the redressability requirement for standing.\n\nAdditionally, "a defendant should be able to accept the entry of a judgment for nominal damages against it and thereby end the litigation without a resolution of the merits."	88
203	DISSENT	"[Plaintiffs] are no longer students at the college. The challenged restrictions no longer exist. And the petitioners have not alleged actual damages. The case is therefore moot because a federal court cannot grant [plaintiffs] 'any effectual relief whatever.'"\n\n"An award of nominal damages does not alleviate the harms suffered by a plaintiff, and is not intended to. If nominal damages can preserve a live controversy, then federal courts will be required to give advisory opinions whenever a plaintiff tacks on a request for a dollar. "	88
204	MAJORITY	Arkansas adopted Act 900 because PBM reimbursement rates were low enough that rural and independent pharmacies were at risk of closing.\n\nERISA was enacted to mandate certain oversight systems for employer plans. ERISA requires these plans to be subject to a uniform body of benefits law. This requires ERISA to preempt state laws that contradict it. However ERISA does not preempt regulations that merely increase costs or alter incentives for ERISA plans without forcing plans to adopt any particular scheme of substantial coverage.\n\nAct 900 does not act immediately and exclusively upon ERISA plans because it applies to PBMs regardless of whether or not they are part of an ERISA plan. It is a cost regulation that is not preempted by ERISA.	62
205	MAJORITY	State courts have limited power of jurisdiction over a defendant. State courts must show that the defendant has "contacts" with the state and "does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice."\n\nFord argues that due process requires jurisdiction only where the car is sold or manufactured. This approach is not supported by the court's precedents.\n\nFord conducts significant business in the state, the accident occurred in the state, and the plaintiff resides in the state. That is sufficient to support specific jurisdiction within the state.	65
206	CONCUR_JUDGEMENT	"These cases can and should be decided without any alteration or refinement of our case law on specific personal jurisdiction."\n\nThe standard of "traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice" is easily met here. Ford has a heavy presence in these states and spends billions on advertising.\n\nThe court today potentially creates a new class of injury where claims are not caused by the defendant's contacts in the state, but nevertheless sufficiently "relate to" those contacts in some way. This innovation is unnecessary and unwise.	65
207	CONCUR_JUDGEMENT	Until now, specific jurisdiction has required two things: The defendant must purposely avail itself of the chance to do business in the state, and the plaintiff's suit must arise out of or relate to the defendant's in-state activities.\n\nThe court now pivots away from this understanding focusing on the "or" in "arise out of or relate to", allowing something to relate to without requiring a causal link. This new test risks adding layers of confusion to our personal injury jurisprudence.\n\nNone of this is to cast doubt on the outcome of this case. Ford entered these jurisdictions through the front door, and jurisdiction is justified. 	65
208	MAJORITY	A seizure requires the use of force with the intent to restrain, as opposed to force applied by accident or for some other purpose. This force can come from physical contact or from a bullet, and does not depend on the subjective motivation of the officer.\n\n"The officers seized Torres by shooting her with the intent to restrain her movement. The court does not address the reasonableness of the seizure, the damages caused by the seizure, or the officers' entitlement to qualified immunity."	68
210	DISSENT	The majority conflates seizure with attempt and confuses arrest with battery. To do this, the majority leans on an abusive and long-abandoned English debt-collection practice. But the constitution does not support this interpretation.\n\nTorres should be free to sue under state law for assault or battery, or for a violation of the 14th amendment, but a 4th amendment seizure only occurs if the government obtains physical control.\n\nThe problem is with the SCOTUS precedent in California v. Hodari D (1991), where the court introduced doubt by implying that merely touching a subject could count as a seizure. Because this passage in Hodari was a hypothetical, it should not be subject to stare decisis.	68
211	MAJORITY	"Florida has not proved by clear and convincing evidence that the collapse of its oyster fisheries was caused by Georgia’s overconsumption." The scientific cause is still unclear, but of the many contributing factors, Florida cannot show that Georgia's overconsumption was substantial, much less the sole cause.	110
225	CONCUR_JUDGEMENT	In the context of ordinary review, a petitioner should be required to raise all relevant arguments during the administrative proceeding. Whether the proceeding is adversarial or not should not impact issue exhaustion.\n\nHowever, I agree that the Appointments Clause issue should fall into the well established exception for futile claims. 	102
226	MAJORITY	The congressional statute authorizes the FTC to pursue federal court orders to "grant mandatory injunctions and such other and further equitable relief as they deem appropriate in the enforcement of such final orders of the Commission."\n\nThe statute "does not explicitly authorize the Commission to obtain court-ordered monetary relief..." The terms of the statute allow prospective injunctive relief and not retrospective monetary relief.\n\nAttempting to issue monetary relief through section 13(b) would circumvent the traditional administrative proceedings. This is supported by the limited monetary relief outlined in section 19. Policy arguments that section 19 is not sufficient to redress consumers should be directed to congress.	83
212	MAJORITY	The FCC considered evidence and reasonably concluded that the three ownership rules at issue were no longer necessary for the goals of competition, localism, and viewpoint diversity. \n\nPrometheus was not able to provide countering data to suggest that repealing these rules would harm female and minority ownership. Prometheus argues that the FCC ignored two such studies, however the FCC appears to have considered those studies and interpreted them differently.\n\n"The APA imposes no general obligation on agencies to conduct or commission their own empirical or statistical studies. And nothing in the Telecommunications Act requires the FCC to conduct such studies before exercising its discretion." In light of the sparse statistical record, the court cannot overturn the judgement of the FCC.	93
213	CONCURRENCE	The FCC is under no obligation to consider minority and female ownership. The third circuit erred by forcing the FCC to defend this non statutory requirement. The result the majority reaches in correct.	93
214	MAJORITY	"The statutory context confirms that the TCPA’s autodialer definition excludes equipment that does not use a random or sequential number generator. Congress found autodialer technology harmful because autodialers can dial emergency lines randomly or tie up all of the sequentially numbered phone lines at a single entity." This best matches Facebook's argument. Duguid's interpretation would cover any device that stores and dials telephone numbers (including cell phones).\n\n"Despite Congress’ general concern about intrusive telemarketing practices, Congress ultimately chose a precise autodialer definition." The argument that the definition is likely to become quickly outdated may or may not be the case "but either way, this Court cannot\nrewrite the TCPA to update it for modern technology."	90
215	CONCUR_JUDGEMENT	Agree with much of the courts judgment, but the court has become over-reliant on the "series-qualifier" canon, which is a useful tool with certain limitations.\n\nThe court uses the canon to interpret rules of grammar in the laws as written, but the series-qualifier is highly sensitive to context; the rule is not supposed to be a strict grammar interpretation but rather to give a sense of what the law's text intelligently conveys.\n\nIt may be possible to someday conduct a linguistic analysis to tell quantitatively how accurate these canons are, but we don't have that yet. Until then, it is important to remember that these are not inflexible rules. 	90
216	MAJORITY	Fair use is a mix of fact and law. Courts should defer to juries on matters of fact, but have the option to review matters of law. A jury cannot fully decide a fair use defense.\n\nTo issue as narrow a ruling as possible, this court does not decide the question of whether or not APIs are copyrightable, and instead only narrowly focuses on the question of fair use in this case.\n\nComputer programs are inherently functional, making it challenging to apply traditional considerations of fair use. In this case, Google copied only the API in order to create a new transformative program, and this constitutes fair use.	64
217	DISSENT	By skipping over the consideration of whether or not software APIs are copyrightable, the court fails to consider the significant protections congress gives to software copyright and therefore badly misconstrues the fair use exception to these protections. The software in this case is copyrightable and Google's use was not fair.\n\nGoogle argues that "declaring code" cannot have copyright as it is solely functional, but declaring code and implementing code go hand in hand, neither is useful without the other.  The majority finds all fair use factors in favor of Google only by drawing a distinction between declaring code an implementing code that does not exist in statutory text.	64
218	MAJORITY	"A sentencer need not make a separate factual finding of permanent incorrigibility before sentencing a murderer under 18 to life without parole." The precedents in Miller and Montgomery "require consideration of an offender’s youth but not any particular factual finding."\n\nThis decision does not reverse the court's precedents. The re-sentencing in this case complies with the requirement that life without parole for a juvenile cannot be mandatory because the judge had the discretion to issue a lighter sentence.\n\nThis decision is not an endorsement of the sentence, and states could impose further sentencing restrictions if they choose to do so.	72
219	CONCUR_JUDGEMENT	The court reaches the correct conclusion, but does so only with a strained reading of Montgomery v. Louisiana. The court should instead admit that Montgomery is irreconcilable with Miller v. Alabama and reverse Montgomery entirely.\n\nMiller was a narrow procedural holding that banned mandatory sentences of life without parole for juveniles. This became a problem when Montgomery tries to apply this rule retroactively. \n\nThe majority overrules Montgomery in substance but not in name. The majority seems to accept that the substantive ruling in Montgomery is not tenable and in tension with Miller, but the only way to successfully reconcile the two is to disregard Montgomery entirely. 	72
220	DISSENT	Today, the court guts its precedents in Miller v. Alabama and Montgomery v. Louisiana. "Miller’s essential holding is that a lifetime in prison is a disproportionate sentence for all but the rarest children, those whose crimes reflect irreparable corruption."\n\nThe majority rules that there needs to be no factual determination that a child sentenced to die in prison is one of these rare cases. Such an abrupt break with precedent should require justification, but the court offers none.\n\nBrett Jones deserves an answer as to "whether his crime demonstrates that he is permanently incorrigible." Thanks to the majority's decision he will never receive an answer to that essential question. 	72
221	MAJORITY	The petitioners received unfavorable judgements from the SSA delivered by Administrative Law Judges that are hired by the SSA rather than appointed under the constitution. They claim this process is a violation of the constitution and that ALJs are subject to the Appointments Clause.\n\nBecause the petitioners failed to raise the issue of the appointments clause during the initial proceedings, lower courts ruled that the issue exhaustion rule prevents them from making this case for the first time in federal court. This court disagrees and remands the case to decide the issues around the appointment clause.\n\nAs to the issue of timeliness, if claimants aren't required to initially raise issues before the ALJ, then raising them for the first time in federal court cannot be untimely.	102
222	MAJORITY	The court's opinion in Sims v. Apfel holds that issue exhaustion is best when parties are engaged in an adversarial process. However, the SSA review process is inquisitive rather than adversarial.\n\nBecause the process is not strictly adversarial in nature, issue exhaustion does not apply and the claimants may make new arguments in federal court that were not raised during that administrative process. 	102
224	CONCUR_JUDGEMENT	Join the court's majority in part that explains why the non-adversarial nature of the administrative process means that issue exhaustion should not apply.\n\nThere is no need for an exhaustion rule, but the analysis should end there and go no further. 	102
