= Documentation for the SCOTUS Tracker API
:toc: left

*Note:* All response values in this documentation are examples only and do not represent actual data that will be returned from the API.
Use the examples here for identifying the structure of the responses and the response types. Values such as Ids, case titles, statuses, etc. are
not tied to any real values and will not match the live API.

== Case
Cases have made it to the Supreme Court. They may have been combined from multiple lower court cases (dockets).
They may or many not have been argued in front of or ruled on by the Supreme Court.

=== Get All Cases
Gets all cases in the API. This is unlikely to be commonly used.

=== Get Cases By Term

.response body

=== Search for Cases
Search for cases. The search term will attempt to match the case title, short summary, and decision summary as well as searching all opinion summaries and docket titles and lower court rulings.

The match criteria for opinion summaries and lower court rulings is a more strict phrase matching than used with the case and docket titles. There are some allowances for partial matches and spelling errors.

Results are ordered by how well they match the search term, with the best match as the first result.

== Dockets
